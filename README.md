# Deep-fakes-
This is a project on Deep Fakes Detection for STAT696 at AU. This is my initial and first attempt with respect to performing deep fakes. Your comments and suggestions are welcome.

Out of all these files, a total of 150 files were chosen, half of which were fake. For having a look at all the files I used, please feel free to have a look at the code output. 

The project poster provides an overview of our thought process and our approach for perforning deep fakes detection.
